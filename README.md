# Plaid-Institution-Logo-Crawler

I created this script to extract logos from Plaid's API and add them to my application's website: https://bankfolio.app/.

I am not an experienced python coder, so these may not be best coding practices, however the script gets the job done and worked for what I needed.

I also did not find this anywhere online, so I thought I would share it to make a developer's life easier; If this helps someone avoid a latenight workday, then my job is complete.

If you would like to support me, please check out BankFolio on the iOS App Store and if you like it leave a review!

This python notebook was created and compiled using: https://jupyter.org/.
